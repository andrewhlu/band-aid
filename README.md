haha funny joke!

You need a service key from Firebase to run this app. Get one from the Firebase Console, name it `serviceAccountKey.json`, and place it in the root directory.

How to build / start application locally:
1. Go in `client` directory, run `npm install`, and then `npm run build`.
2. Go in root directory (`band-aid`) and run `npm start`.
